# Khaos: WPF Web Browser
not mine!, just copy from 
CodePlex http://khaos.codeplex.com/  commit: 76924, 
 
This project is the development of a web browser in C#

The browser is still in early stages of development and only supports basic static webpages.

Note: this project is now out of date and has no activity, I'll update this page when and if that changes

The Khaos project goals are to build a browser that is easy to understand and extend.
This is done by placing focus on high quality design and architecture the result is a highly extensible
and modular series of web technology components.
Emphasis is also placed on simplicity and code quality in order to enhance understanding and extensibility.
